TryCatch::Error - A simple error base class.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides a building block to writing your own error objects, to use with TryCatch (or some similar module).

It enables you to write things like this, straight away:

    use TryCatch::Error;
    use TryCatch;

    try {
        # ...
        # something that can go horribly wrong
        if ( $error_condition ) {
            die TryCatch::Error->new( value => $foo, string => $bar );
        }
    }
    catch ( TryCatch::Error $e ) {
        print STDERR 'Ooops: ', $e->get_string, 'with ', $e->get_value;
    }

TryCatch::Error can be sub-classed to create your own errors (possibly containing more detail, see t/03-subclassing.t for an example).
